(I'm so happy A.I. is on the rise, so psychology and informatics are becoming more and more close fields.
To teach people and robots, we should make a tutorials.)

As I spend most of my socials online time on Github and PHP# related discussion, I've noticed **many people do so many wrong things** while giving critits.

I want to **correct this** once and for all, so I've prepared a guide .

## 1. Find an error

This is very easy step that many people can handle. Just pick something wrong in a project, or content and point it out.

Also, comment only thing, where is no request for critics. The worst think you can do is actually help the prson who want's some feedback.

## 2. Strong Intro

No hello or hi, never use a surname and NEVER use a name. Just write right away, what is wrong. Some example:

- this post is complicated, what is the point?
- well that was boring
- this is not how to use that
- you can't use foreach here

### Minitip: Evaluate

We should be clear and right to the point. Only that way the other person knows what is this about and can do something about that.

- This is definitelly wrong

### Minitiop: point out the other person is bellow you

- missing education: read the docs first, please
- more stupid: lol, you really think this is the way to use it?

## 3. Never back up, you're not a pussy

When you get a response, it is usually very rude like for no reason. You only are trying to help the second person.

- what do you mean by that?
- I'm not sure.

He is only prettending he doesn't know. But you are smarter than him to recognize.

## 4. Repeat the same
 
If the other doens't want to listen, he probably didn't read our comments. Who can blame him, it today's world full of social media distrations.
There is no better solution than point that out.

- I wrote that already.

...and repeat, but only if you have mood for long comments:

- I wrote that already, see comment up.

...or in rare cases it can be:

- I wrote that already, this is wrong way to use this.

## 5. Point out places to learn from

As our mission is to educate other about their mistakes, we should always provide a source of knowledge.

- Read the docs first.
- it's in the manual
- read php manual

Today, we have google, so there is no need to use actuall link. Everybody can google now.
And if they don't, they're stupid and they should learn that.

### Minitip: use shortcuts, they save tiem

All people in the field know all the shortucs avilable, so why not use them so save time in conversation.

- Hey, why don't you use IDE?
- use Docker AWS setup instead lol

## 6. Belive in yourself

You knwo the best, never forget that. And if other try to change your mind, they probably don't know nothing.

Stick to your believes and don't let anyone to question it. 

- no, you don't undeerstand this

You're the most objective person there could be, so use it.

## 7. Always tell, never ask

Because many peple are missing parenting, you're here for them to help them with raising to propper programmer.

Always, tell the other person what to do or how the world works. It's objective true.

- "..."

Asking is sign of not-knowing and weakness. And parent's can be weka, they're here for us - sth like a service.

## 8. keep it shor, never  provide a reason

To make conversion fast, always talks about your final ideas. There is not time to provide motivation reason, or even expalin to the other person.
It's obvious already and he should know it. Or just google it.

- I want to deprecate this feature.

## Disclaimer

Motivated by 2Verritasium with "start with misconceptions first", I've put down this post as pre-sequal to "How to give feedback that helps you both".

All misconceptions I could think of are here. If I forgot any, please help me to comlete it.

If you know Czech, you can check my video from PHPLive 2016, where I address similar topi.

# How to give feedback that helps you both

After [misconceptions](), we can move to really what matter **to me** - emphatic feedback.

Once I've read few misconseptions about marriage:
we have a strong feeling, that when we point out mistakes we see at other people, they will change that.

## 1. Is feedback desired

do you want to hear it?
the best is to answer 

## 2. what is my motivation

- This is not easy to hear, but usually it is just projection. Even now, when I'm writing this post, I frustrated with something else - about our educational system and misconceptions it teaches people.

## 3. make a raport

You can find this in all books on persuassion: if you want to persuade someone, start in a friendly way.

I didn't know about this for a long time, so I started with rationalization and arguments:

- Hey, you have to use IDE, becuase it will help you with productivity a lot.
- You should use Symfony, because it's more matured than any other frameworks!

This only forces the other for defense, even if you don't. Sorry brain.

Instead, you can maek a raprt - a short term friendship if you like.

### ask

- What do you mean by "this is too complicated"? What part exactly don't you understand?

### confirm

- I agree you might have problems reading this, since it's your first time and I use this for over 3 years and know it by heart.

## 4. replace "you + the future" with "I + the present"

- You'll definitelly find IDE useful =>
- I find IDE useful.

## 5. repalte they or everybody with "me"

It's natuaral to claim personal believes as a personal one's. 

- Programmers have to work hard to get such money.

## 6. provide a reason

- I'd recommend you to do this because it helped me in this and this

## We all fail to be ideal, practise
